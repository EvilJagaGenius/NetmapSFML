open~Opening|!CI:GemmaDefault !SK:|Hey.  Glad you could make it.  Take a seat.|Gemma Burkowski, Netmap Agency.  You must be the guy I've been reading about.  Don't worry, looks are decieving, your file's not that thick.|In fact, we didn't even have one on you until a few weeks ago when you sent in the application.  Which, I'm sure you've guessed, is why I asked to meet you here.|You know how this works.  We don't recruit, we don't do scholarships.  People want to join the Agency, they talk to us.  And I'll be honest with you, we're... a little short on manpower at the moment.  Still !PS:10 . !PS:10 . !PS:10 .|There's some generic answers in here, but I'd rather hear it from you.  Would put my mind at ease.  Tell me, why do you want to be a Netmap agent?  If you wanted to be a hacker, join a corporation.  Or be a warez dev.  Or, heck, apply to Lucky Monkey and write games.  So... why precisely do you want to throw in your lot with the Agency? !CB:knowledge:order:altruism
knowledge~Knowledge|So you want to see the inner circle, huh?  I suppose that works.  But riddle me this, friend - what if that circle isn't all that you think it is?  Or what if it's circles on circles, and there are some layers to the onion you can't peel back?|!GT:exit:1
order~Order|Friend, if you're looking for order... well, this is one heck of a way to find it.  The Netmap's almost built on anarchy.  And the funny thing?  People like it.|Now, I like having peace and structure to things too, but... well, it might be a bit of a bumpy ride.|!GT:exit:1
altruism~Altruism|Well, that's not bad.  There's no shame in wanting to be the white knight who comes to everyone's aid.  Still, if that's what you wanted, surely there's humane societies and hospitals that could use a code monkey as much as us.|To be blunt, we're underground, friend.  Sure, you can help people out here, be a wonderful human being, but... who's going to know?  Or care?  If you're fine with that... well, that's good.  But ideals can only carry you so far.|!GT:exit:1
exit~Exit Conversation|Still, I can respect that.  That badge is yours, if you want it.|[SECURITY LEVEL 1 GRANTED]|Then welcome to the Agency, friend.  Ready for your first day of class?|!XX:
